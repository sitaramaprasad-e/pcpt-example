Domain Specific Hints
* Generate a single page application component using React, assuming there is a separate microservice that implements the backend which this component will call.
* Use createRoot from react-dom/client instead of ReactDOM.render.
* Keep list items in order with a key.
* Ensure all buttons suggested by spec are shown and are functional.
* Create an environment file to specify the port for the backend microservice as well as the names of the API properties used by the backend e.g. SHIPID instead of id.
* Write out log statements to the browser's console
* Follow best practices for React development.
